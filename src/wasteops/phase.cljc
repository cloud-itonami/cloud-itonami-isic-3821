  "Phase 0->3 staged rollout for the ISIC-3821 non-hazardous-waste
  treatment-and-disposal operations-coordination actor.

    Phase 0  read-only              -- no writes, still governor-gated.
    Phase 1  assisted-logging       -- facility-record logging
                                       allowed, every write needs
                                       human approval.
    Phase 2  assisted-coordination  -- adds maintenance scheduling and
                                       shipment-coordination writes,
                                       still approval.
    Phase 3  supervised auto        -- governor-clean, high-confidence
                                       `:log-facility-record`/
                                       `:schedule-maintenance`/
                                       `:coordinate-shipment` may
                                       auto-commit. `:flag-safety-
                                       concern` NEVER auto-commits, at
                                       any phase.

  `:flag-safety-concern` is deliberately ABSENT from every phase's
  `:auto` set, including phase 3 -- a permanent structural fact, not a
  rollout milestone still to come. Surfacing a safety concern always
  needs a human to actually look at it. `wasteops.governor`'s own
  `always-escalate-ops` enforces the same invariant independently --
  two layers, not one, agree on this."
